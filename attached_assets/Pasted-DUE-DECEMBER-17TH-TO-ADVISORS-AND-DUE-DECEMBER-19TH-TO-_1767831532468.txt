2.2   MARKETING STRATEGY
Target Market
Who will buy your product (age ranges, gender, location, etc.)? Why? Does your market research support this (refer to section 2.4)?
Our target market is teenagers aged 14-18, regardless of gender, primarily located within local schools. This includes students who are conscious about animal endangeredment, interested in fashionable accessories, and motivated by social and environmental impact.
Demographic: 96.2% of form respondents (50 out of 52) were aged 14-18, confirming that teenagers are the most relevant and interested audience

Gender: Wyldstone Perspective Survey was released on social media and although 67.3% of respondents identified as female, this does not necessarily mean only females are interested. This higher response rate likely mirrors who chose to complete the survey, rather than excluding interest from other genders. Our product remains gender-inclusive, as charm bracelets and environmental causes appeal across genders. 

Interest levels were strong (92.3% showed at least moderate interest in a bracelet that supports wildlife conservation):
38.5% were extremely interested
28.8% were very interested
25% were moderately interested

Promotion and Advertising
How are you going to promote your products? Slogans? Displays? Word-of-mouth? TV/Radio ads? What type of promotion/advertising would be successful for you and why?
Wyldstone will primarily use low-cost, high-impact digital marketing strategies that align with teenage media consumption habits.

Promotion Methods:
Word-of-mouth marketing within schools (friends, classmates, eco-clubs)
Instagram content, including: product teasers before launch, short-form videos showcasing bracelet designs, informative posts about endangered animals, trendy videos familiarizing our customers with the team
In-person displays at schools, seminars using clean, aesthetic setups

Ensuring effectiveness:
100% of respondents use social media (Instagram/Tiktok)
Teenagers engage mostly with short, trendy, visually appealing content
Posting both trendy and educational content maintains brand credibility while keeping engagement high

2.3   BUDGETS/SALES FORECASTING

PRODUCTION PLAN
To be completed by VP Production
3.1   GOALS AND OBJECTIVES
What are your goals/objectives when it comes to producing your product (e.g. Production goal, product quality [what is high quality to you?], efficiency, environmental considerations, etc.)? List up to five SMART goals. Each goal must have up to three specific actions you will take to ensure the goal is met.
SMART Goal 1: Production Output
Goal: Produce and sell 600 bracelets over the 12 week program to meet company sales targets.
Specific: The production team will create bracelets during weekly JA meetings, with all members participating in bracelet assembly.


Measurable: We will produce 50 bracelets per week (600 ÷ 12 weeks), tracked at the end of each meeting.

SMART Goal 2: Product Quality
Goal: Ensure all bracelets meet a consistent standard of durability and appearance.
Specific: Bracelets must be securely tied, visually consistent, and durable for everyday wear.


Measurable: Each batch will undergo a basic durability check including knot strength and bead security.


Achievable: Quality checks are simple and require no additional tools or training.

Specific: Each member will independently cut string and assemble their own bracelets.


Measurable: Production efficiency is met if 50 bracelets are completed within meeting time.


Achievable: The bracelet design is simple and does not require an assembly line.


Relevant: Efficient workflow ensures production targets are met without delays.


Time Bound: Efficiency will be evaluated weekly during each JA meeting.


Actions to ensure success:
Provide a short production refresher if needed


VP of Production assists members who fall behind


Adjust workload if production goals are not met


Environmental Considerations:
Materials are sourced from Amazon due to the lack of local suppliers offering the required beads. While shipping involves planes and trucks, efforts were made to search for local options first. Orders will be consolidated to minimize environmental impact.

3.2   FACILITIES AND LABOUR
Where are you making the product? Who is making the product (VPs or non-VPs)? One paragraph, 4–6 lines.
The product will be made in office rooms 1 and 2, which will serve as the primary production and assembly spaces. These rooms are equipped to support hands on work, coordination, and quality checks throughout the process. The VP of Production will oversee and lead all manufacturing activities to ensure standards and timelines are met. Day to day production will be carried out by members of the production department along with volunteers from other departments as needed. This structure ensures clear leadership while allowing flexible support to meet production demands efficiently.
3.3   MATERIALS PROCUREMENT
Where are you buying the materials for your product? Who is responsible for picking them up/buying them? How are you ensuring that checks have been made on the Code of Ethics of suppliers. One paragraph, 3–5 lines. Include the contact info of your possible suppliers. For example:
Any store 12345—123 St.
Any town, Province 
www.anystore.com
	
Materials for the product will be purchased through Amazon. Purchasing is handled by the Team Leader using a company credit card, with expenses later reimbursed through collected shares, and all items are shipped directly to the Team Leader’s residence and brought to the next meeting. Supplier ethics are reviewed by checking product reviews for quality, performing a basic online background check for any ethical concerns, and minimizing environmental impact by consolidating shipments into single deliveries.
3.4   PRODUCTION PROCESS 
How are you making your product? What are the steps involved? Describe the steps in detail with specific materials/measurements. We should be able to put your product together after reading this.
Buy items from amazon. We have string, beads, and charms. Cut the string to exactly 6.5 inches using a ruler and scissors. Tie a knot on one end of the string so beads don't slide off. Slide 11 beads onto the string from the unknotted side. Add the charm. Add the remaining 11 beads. Hold both ends of the string and tie a double knot in order to keep the beads on. Cut off any stubborn/excess pieces of string.
3.5   TRAINING 
Who is responsible for training your members in the production process? How will they be trained? What date did training happen? What are the safety issues when producing your product? How will you prevent accidents? One paragraph, 8–12 lines.
Production team as well as members who have experience making bead bracelets will lead the bracelet makers in a quick tutorial. Learning should only take a few minutes as it is a simple concept. We will have a training day on the first week back after the break. The only safety concern is the cutting of string, which we will use safety scissors for so you can not get cut.
3.6   QUALITY CONTROL 
How do you insure that each product is made with the same quality? Describe what a high-quality product looks like. Two paragraphs, 5–8 lines.
To ensure each product is made with the same quality, we will use the same string for each bracelet, The same beads for each bracelet, and the same length for each bracelet. A high quality bead bracelet is something that can last forever due to the elasticity in the string. The only way this product can break is if it is put under immense stress and is pulled apart extremely. This bracelet will have solid beads.
3.7   INVENTORY CONTROL 
How will you keep track of all: Materials inventory, products not yet completed, products already completed? One paragraph, 5–8 lines.
In order to keep track of materials inventory, products not yet completed, and products that are already completed. We will be using a google spreadsheet and this spreadsheet will record what materials inventory, products not yet completed and products that are already completed. We will also make sure orders are tracked and confirm that the product was sent to the buyer.
 3.8   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
How will you improve your product? Who is responsible for doing that? How will you determine what needs to be improved? One paragraph, 5–8 lines.
We will have our marketing team work with our csr team to find out what colour ways the people want, and use our same ethical supplier to supply our beads. We will send consistent surveys and ask people about their opinions whenever they purchase. We will determine if the string needs to be improved by comparing it to the other options we have purchased. We will determine if the size of the beads is good based on the number of bracelets we can make from one package of 6mm beads.








HUMAN RESOURCES
To be completed by VP Human Resources
4.1   GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
What are your goals/objectives when it comes to keeping a well-run team (e.g. Attendance, compensation, retention, social entrepreneurship, etc.)? List up to five SMART goals. Each goal must have up to three specific actions you will take to ensure the goal is met. How will you ensure that all employees are aware of the Code of Ethics outlined in the Employee hand book?

1. Sales Goal: Sell 600 bracelets by the end of the campaign, with 100 at the trade show and the remaining 500 divided among 15 team members.

5. Community Engagement: Reach at least 50 community members to promote social entrepreneurship.
Actions: Include social mission info in sales pitches, host community events, and partner with local groups.

4.2   COMPENSATION PLAN 

What salaries and wages are you paying your employees? Ensure that they meet minimum wage standards. Are you paying commission? Is there another form of compensation you are using? One paragraph, 4–6 lines.
For example:
Executives
Salary: $3.00/week 
Commission: 10% on all personal sales 
Officers
Wages: $1.00/hour for minimum 2.5 hours 
Commission: 10% on all personal sales 

Wyldestone pays each team member a weekly wage of $0.50, which meets minimum wage requirements. There is no overtime pay or additional compensation beyond this weekly wage. The team does not receive any commissions on sales; instead, a prize is awarded weekly to the top salesperson to encourage motivation. Team members who are absent during the week do not receive wages for that week, emphasizing the importance of attendance and participation.

4.3   TRAINING 
How will all the members of your company be trained (production, marketing, etc.)? Officer orientation does NOT count as training. Who is responsible for each training session? What day(s) did training occur? One paragraph, 5–8 lines.

All team members will be trained in all departments, including production, marketing, and sales, to ensure they can effectively contribute to Wyldestone’s goals. For bracelet-making, experienced team members who already know how to produce bracelets will teach others, while those new to production can access instructional videos. Advisors trained in each department are also available to provide additional assistance and guidance as needed. The executive is responsible for coordinating and ensuring that everyone in each department receives proper training. Any training sessions are discussed and planned during the executive meeting held the day before our weekly team meetings, which occur every Wednesday. This approach guarantees that training is organized, consistent, and tailored to the team’s needs.

FINANCIAL PLAN
To be completed by VP Finance

5.1   GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 
What are your goals/objectives when it comes to your company’s finances (e.g. Financial goals, return to shareholders, timely payments, etc.)? List up to
five SMART goals. Each goal must have up to three specific actions you will take to ensure the goal is met. What percentage of your proceeds did you donate to the not-for-profit/charity your Company selected? How did you determine how much to donate?

Goal 1: Achieve $6,000 in total revenue by the end of the JA Program (April 10th)
Track weekly revenue using Company Program Record Keeping Spreadsheet
Compare actual revenue to budget and adjust spending if necessary
Ensure pricing remains consistent and realistic across all sales channels
Goal 2: Reach the breakeven point within the first third of the selling period
Monitor fixed and variable costs weekly
Control Material purchasing to avoid unnecessary expenses
Align production quantities with sales trends to prevent excess inventory
Goal 3: Maintain a positive net profit while supporting charitable donations
Keep variable costs at or below $4.26 per unit
Donate 10% of profits towards the " Adopt an Animal " program
Review profit margins regularly to ensure sustainability
Goal 4: Provide a positive return on investment (ROI) to shareholders
Limit non-essential expenses
Track share value projections through the selling period and adjust goals accordingly
Ensure profits are distributed fairly at liquidation.
Goal 5: Maintain accurate, ethical, and timely financial records
Update all financial records weekly
Review transactions with another executive to reduce errors
Follow the JA Test of Fisclosure and Code of Ethics at all times


5.2   INITIAL CAPITALIZATION 
How many shares did your company sell (number and dollar value)? How much money do you need to start your company? Why? What are your specific costs of capitalization (initial material purchases, initial promotional materials, etc.) that this money will cover? 1–2 paragraphs, 6–9 lines.

Wyldstone raised its start-up funds through the sale of common shares to company members and preferred shares to advisors.

The company sold 20 common shares at $30 per share, raising $600 from student shareholders. In addition, 6 preferred shares were sold to advisors at $50 per share, raising an additional $300. This resulted in a total initial capitalization of $900.

Although initial purchases have not yet been made, the funds raised are intended to cover forecasted start-up and operating costs, including materials, packaging, and promotional expenses. Based on financial planning, Wyldstone has identified $458.82 in fixed costs, which the initial capitalization comfortably covers. Securing sufficient capital in advance allows the company to begin operations without relying on debt and ensures financial stability as sales begin.

Capitalization Requirements

5.3   BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS  
What are your fixed costs? What are your variable costs? What is your breakeven point in dollars and units? Use the calculations found in your breakeven spreadsheet in the Company Program Record Keeping Spreadsheet. One paragraph, 3–5 lines.

Wyldstone’s fixed costs are $458.82, which include forecasted operating and start-up expenses. The variable cost per unit is $4.26, while the selling price per unit is $10.00, resulting in a contribution margin of $5.74 per unit. Based on these figures, the company’s break-even point is approximately 80 units, meaning Wyldstone must sell 80 units to cover all costs. This corresponds to a break-even revenue of $800, after which the company will begin generating profit.

break-even analysis

Attach the breakeven spreadsheet from the Company Program Record Keeping Spreadsheet and a breakeven analysis graph (that you create) in Appendix C.
5.4   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
Income Statement
Attach your Income Statement Forecast (the Budget from the Company Program Record Keeping Spreadsheet) in Appendix D. Ensure that there are NO entries in your financial worksheet at this time so that the “Actual” and “% of Budget achieved” columns are empty.
Balance Sheet
Attach FORECAST Balance Sheet in Appendix D (what your Balance Sheet will look like after you meet your sales goal but before you liquidate). You can use the same format as the Balance Sheet in the Company Program Record Keeping Spreadsheet, but you will need to input in values in each area OUTSIDE of the Company Program Record Keeping Spreadsheet.
Balance Sheet and Income Statement Forecasting with Sales Goal
5.5   RISKS 
What financial risks are involved in making and selling this type of product? How much money could you lose? What would happen to your shareholders? One paragraph, 5–8 lines.

The main financial risks for our company come from fluctuations in sales, unexpected increases in material or operational costs, and the possibility of not meeting our production or revenue targets. If sales are lower than expected or costs are higher, profits could decrease, which may affect dividends to shareholders. Additionally, delays or errors in production could lead to wasted materials or missed opportunities. Careful planning and monitoring of finances are essential to reduce these risks.

How are you going to get all information from other areas? What specific time(s) will you be collecting this information? How are you going to ensure that data is safe and confidential? What will you do with the paper copy of the record? How will you ensure the information is accurate? 1–2 paragraphs.
 Information from other areas will be collected through authorized channels such as official records, verified databases, emails, and scheduled meetings with relevant staff. Data collection will occur at specific, planned times (for example, during designated work hours or at the end of each reporting period) to ensure consistency and minimize errors. Only information that is directly relevant to the task will be gathered, and sources will be cross-checked to confirm reliability.
To ensure data is safe and confidential, all digital information will be stored on password-protected systems with limited access, and files will only be shared with authorized individuals. Paper records will be kept in a locked cabinet and securely shredded once they are no longer needed. Accuracy will be maintained by reviewing entries carefully, comparing data from multiple sources, and correcting any discrepancies immediately.




6.3   ONLINE TOOLS 
What specific online tools will your company utilize? Website? Email? Social media (working with VP Marketing)? How will you ensure that the logo/name and bradn used by the Company is not a copyright an infringement? 1–2 paragraphs.

 Our company will be utilizing a personal website through a custom domain bought under the domain wyldstone.ca. We will be hosting our website on this domain, utilizing it as the main source for online marketing and payments. We will also be using the following email: wyldstoneja@gmail.com for all inquiries regarding our business. These dependencies will all be connected to our LinkTree, which will connect our Instagram, website, and email as the main hub for all online communication. To add on, we will be using Instagram as the main form for social media content, where all publicity will be gained through the posts and appeals made online. We will be using Stripe for online payments on our website, and using Replit and GitHub to make the website itself. However, we also plan on testing many other AI tools to generate our own AI for the company to promote our product and CSR initiative. 

The Company will ensure its logo, name, and brand do not infringe on existing copyrights or trademarks by doing thorough research on its name and companies associated with it. If needed, we can also check national registries and databases to ensure that there is no overlap. We have already done research on possible conflicts, and have yet to find any errors or possible overlaps with others.

Overview of Not-for-Profit/Charitable Organization the Company donated to
The charitable organization that will be donated to is the Toronto Zoo Wildlife Conservancy . The Toronto Zoo's endangered animal program, supported by the Toronto Zoo Wildlife Conservancy, focuses on fighting extinction through species recovery, conservation breeding, and reintroduction, funding projects locally and globally for species like the White Rhinoceros and Red Panda. A portion, 10% of each sale of a bracelet will be donated to the Toronto Zoo. The proceeds can go towards either adopting a certain animal from the zoo or funding their overall  endangered animal protection as well. The process of adopting an animal can be meaningful and rewarding. Here is a layout of some animals that can be donated to as well as their donation page: 


Pros and Cons of the Toronto Zoo Wildlife Conservancy: 
Pros: 
Supports well-established conservation, research, and breeding programs for endangered species.
Millions of visitors each year learn about wildlife protection.
Trusted, transparent, and reputable Canadian organization, so we are keeping it close to home 

Cons: 
Some people disagree with keeping animals in captivity in the first place.
Not all of the animals align with the ones we put in our survey 
Funding is spread across programs, so it goes towards zoo operations as well, not directly to the animals that are endangered
